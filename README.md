 completed the Move, Jump function, and I made about half of the Sticked-Jump function.
 Sticked-Jump function has 2 bugs.
 First is automatic jump end bug, I think it is occured by CancelInvoke
 and Second is automatic move bug after sticked jump landing, I think it is occured by CancelInvoke too.
